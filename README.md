# social-media-app-with-hate-speech-detection


### What and why this project: 

This project involved developing a social media web application where users can create a post, like and share posts of other users. Some users donâ€™t want to see hateful messages, and are deeply affected if they read/see any hateful messages, so to solve this problem a hate speech detection filter is developed. A warning will be provided stating that the post is hateful. User will still be able to view the message if he/she wishes to by accepting the warning.


### Tech stack:

1. MERN (MongoDB, Express, React JS, Node JS) stack for Web App
2. Python, NLTK, Tensorflow

### End product:

The end product is a web-app where the users can upload posts and see the posts of other users . If the posts in the feed are detected as hate speech by the ML algo, the posts would be initially hidden and would be shown only with the consent of the user.
